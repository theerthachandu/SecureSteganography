Secure Steganography Using Image Processing

This project is a steganography tool that hides secret messages inside an image using image processing techniques. The message can only be retrieved by entering the correct passcode.

Features:
->Hides text messages inside an image without visible changes.
->Requires a passcode for decryption, ensuring security.
->Uses OpenCV for image processing.
->Simple and efficient implementation.

Technology Used:
Programming Language: Python
Libraries Used: OpenCV (cv2), OS


Enter the secret message and passcode when prompted.
An encrypted image will be created.
To decrypt, run the script again and enter the correct passcode.

End Users:
->People who want to securely hide and share sensitive information.
->Researchers and developers interested in digital data hiding.

Future Scope:
->Adding support for multiple file formats (audio, video, PDFs).
->Implementing stronger encryption techniques.
->Developing a GUI for user-friendly access.
->Creating a mobile app for secure message hiding.
